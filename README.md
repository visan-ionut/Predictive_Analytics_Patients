There are practical tasks for engineers or researchers focused on three main areas:
data visualization and exploratory analysis, feature extraction for classification,
regression, or anomaly detection, and evaluating various models to optimize solutions
for a given problem. Was used data visualization libraries, apply feature extraction
techniques discussed in lectures, and employ simple machine learning models.
The dataset provided contains 18 attributes from diagnosed patients, and the task is
to train models that accurately predict these diagnoses. Key activities include performing
exploratory data analysis, handling missing data, applying feature selection techniques,
tuning algorithms using grid search with cross-validation, and conducting a thorough
evaluation of the chosen models, including precision, recall, and F1 scores for each class.

Also attached a detailed report analyzing the results and discussing the predictive power and
impact of hyperparameters on performance.
